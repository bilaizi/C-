/**
 * struct bus_type - The bus type of the device
 *
 * @name:	The name of the bus.
 * @dev_name:	Used for subsystems to enumerate devices like ("foo%u", dev->id).
 * @dev_root:	Default device to use as the parent.
 * @bus_groups:	Default attributes of the bus.
 * @dev_groups:	Default attributes of the devices on the bus.
 * @drv_groups: Default attributes of the device drivers on the bus.
 * @match:	Called, perhaps multiple times, whenever a new device or driver is added for this bus. 
 *		It should return a positive value if the given device can be handled by the given driver and zero otherwise. 
 *		It may also return error code if determining that the driver supports the device is not possible. 
 *		In case of -EPROBE_DEFER it will queue the device for deferred probing.
 * @uevent:	Called when a device is added, removed, or a few other things 
                that generate uevents to add the environment variables.
 * @probe:	Called when a new device or driver add to this bus, 
                and callback the specific driver's probe to initial the matched device.
 * @remove:	Called when a device removed from this bus.
 * @shutdown:	Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device.
 * @online:	Called to put the device back online (after offlining it).
 * @offline:	Called to put the device offline for hot-removal. May fail.
 * @suspend:	Called when a device on this bus wants to go to sleep mode.
 * @resume:	Called to bring a device on this bus out of sleep mode.
 * @num_vf:	Called to find out how many virtual functions a device on this bus supports.
 * @pm:		Power management operations of this bus, callback the specific device driver's pm-ops.
 * @iommu_ops:  IOMMU specific operations for this bus, used to attach IOMMU driver implementations to a bus 
                and allow the driver to do bus-specific setup
 * @p:		The private data of the driver core, only the driver core can touch this.
 * @lock_key:	Lock class key for use by the lock validator
 * @force_dma:	Assume devices on this bus should be set up by dma_configure()
 * 		even if DMA capability is not explicitly described by firmware.
 *
 * A bus is a channel between the processor and one or more devices. For the
 * purposes of the device model, all devices are connected via a bus, even if
 * it is an internal, virtual, "platform" bus. Buses can plug into each other.
 * A USB controller is usually a PCI device, for example. The device model
 * represents the actual connections between buses and the devices they control.
 * A bus is represented by the bus_type structure. It contains the name, the
 * default attributes, the bus' methods, PM operations, and the driver core's
 * private data.

/**
 * struct device - The basic device structure
 * @parent:	The device's "parent" device, the device to which it is attached.
 * 		In most cases, a parent device is some sort of bus or host
 * 		controller. If parent is NULL, the device, is a top-level device,
 * 		which is not usually what you want.
 * @p:		Holds the private data of the driver core portions of the device.
 * 		See the comment of the struct device_private for detail.
 * @kobj:	A top-level, abstract class from which other classes are derived.
 * @init_name:	Initial name of the device.
 * @type:	The type of device. This identifies the device type and carries type-specific information.
 * @mutex:	Mutex to synchronize calls to its driver.
 * @bus:	Type of bus device is on.
 * @driver:	Which driver has allocated this
 * @platform_data: Platform data specific to the device.
 * 		Example: For devices on custom boards, as typical of embedded
 * 		and SOC based hardware, Linux often uses platform_data to point
 * 		to board-specific structures describing devices and how they
 * 		are wired.  That can include what ports are available, chip
 * 		variants, which GPIO pins act in what additional roles, and so
 * 		on.  This shrinks the "Board Support Packages" (BSPs) and
 * 		minimizes board-specific #ifdefs in drivers.
 * @driver_data: Private pointer for driver specific info.
 * @links:	Links to suppliers and consumers of this device.
 * @power:	For device power management.
 *		See Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst for details.
 * @pm_domain:	Provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
 * 		hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions
 * 		along with subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
 * @pins:	For device pin management.
 *		See Documentation/driver-api/pinctl.rst for details.
 * @msi_list:	Hosts MSI descriptors
 * @msi_domain: The generic MSI domain this device is using.
 * @numa_node:	NUMA node this device is close to.
 * @dma_ops:    DMA mapping operations for this device.
 * @dma_mask:	Dma mask (if dma'ble device).
 * @coherent_dma_mask: Like dma_mask, but for alloc_coherent mapping as not all
 * 		hardware supports 64-bit addresses for consistent allocations
 * 		such descriptors.
 * @dma_pfn_offset: offset of DMA memory range relatively of RAM
 * @dma_parms:	A low level driver may set these to teach IOMMU code about
 * 		segment limitations.
 * @dma_pools:	Dma pools (if dma'ble device).
 * @dma_mem:	Internal for coherent mem override.
 * @cma_area:	Contiguous memory area for dma allocations
 * @archdata:	For arch-specific additions.
 * @of_node:	Associated device tree node.
 * @fwnode:	Associated device node supplied by platform firmware.
 * @devt:	For creating the sysfs "dev".
 * @id:		device instance
 * @devres_lock: Spinlock to protect the resource of the device.
 * @devres_head: The resources list of the device.
 * @knode_class: The node used to add the device to the class list.
 * @class:	The class of the device.
 * @groups:	Optional attribute groups.
 * @release:	Callback to free the device after all references have
 * 		gone away. This should be set by the allocator of the
 * 		device (i.e. the bus driver that discovered the device).
 * @iommu_group: IOMMU group the device belongs to.
 * @iommu_fwspec: IOMMU-specific properties supplied by firmware.
 *
 * @offline_disabled: If set, the device is permanently online.
 * @offline:	Set after successful invocation of bus type's .offline().
 * @of_node_reused: Set if the device-tree node is shared with an ancestor device.
 *
 * At the lowest level, every device in a Linux system is represented by an
 * instance of struct device. The device structure contains the information
 * that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems,
 * however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a
 * result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures;
 * instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within
 * a higher-level representation of the device.

/**
 * struct gpio_chip - abstract a GPIO controller
 * @label: a functional name for the GPIO device, such as a part
 *	number or the name of the SoC IP-block implementing it.
 * @gpiodev: the internal state holder, opaque struct
 * @parent: optional parent device providing the GPIOs
 * @owner: helps prevent removal of modules exporting active GPIOs
 * @request: optional hook for chip-specific activation, such as
 *	enabling module power and clock; may sleep
 * @free: optional hook for chip-specific deactivation, such as
 *	disabling module power and clock; may sleep
 * @get_direction: returns direction for signal "offset", 0=out, 1=in,
 *	(same as GPIOF_DIR_XXX), or negative error
 * @direction_input: configures signal "offset" as input, or returns error
 * @direction_output: configures signal "offset" as output, or returns error
 * @get: returns value for signal "offset", 0=low, 1=high, or negative error
 * @get_multiple: reads values for multiple signals defined by "mask" and
 *	stores them in "bits", returns 0 on success or negative error
 * @set: assigns output value for signal "offset"
 * @set_multiple: assigns output values for multiple signals defined by "mask"
 * @set_config: optional hook for all kinds of settings. Uses the same
 *	packed config format as generic pinconf.
 * @to_irq: optional hook supporting non-static gpio_to_irq() mappings;
 *	implementation may not sleep
 * @dbg_show: optional routine to show contents in debugfs; default code
 *	will be used when this is omitted, but custom code can show extra
 *	state (such as pullup/pulldown configuration).
 * @base: identifies the first GPIO number handled by this chip;
 *	or, if negative during registration, requests dynamic ID allocation.
 *	DEPRECATION: providing anything non-negative and nailing the base
 *	offset of GPIO chips is deprecated. Please pass -1 as base to
 *	let gpiolib select the chip base in all possible cases. We want to
 *	get rid of the static GPIO number space in the long run.
 * @ngpio: the number of GPIOs handled by this controller; the last GPIO
 *	handled is (base + ngpio - 1).
 * @names: if set, must be an array of strings to use as alternative
 *      names for the GPIOs in this chip. Any entry in the array
 *      may be NULL if there is no alias for the GPIO, however the
 *      array must be @ngpio entries long.  A name can include a single printk
 *      format specifier for an unsigned int.  It is substituted by the actual
 *      number of the gpio.
 * @can_sleep: flag must be set iff get()/set() methods sleep, as they
 *	must while accessing GPIO expander chips over I2C or SPI. This
 *	implies that if the chip supports IRQs, these IRQs need to be threaded
 *	as the chip access may sleep when e.g. reading out the IRQ status
 *	registers.
 * @read_reg: reader function for generic GPIO
 * @write_reg: writer function for generic GPIO
 * @be_bits: if the generic GPIO has big endian bit order (bit 31 is representing
 *	line 0, bit 30 is line 1 ... bit 0 is line 31) this is set to true by the
 *	generic GPIO core. It is for internal housekeeping only.
 * @reg_dat: data (in) register for generic GPIO
 * @reg_set: output set register (out=high) for generic GPIO
 * @reg_clr: output clear register (out=low) for generic GPIO
 * @reg_dir: direction setting register for generic GPIO
 * @bgpio_bits: number of register bits used for a generic GPIO i.e.
 *	<register width> * 8
 * @bgpio_lock: used to lock chip->bgpio_data. Also, this is needed to keep
 *	shadowed and real data registers writes together.
 * @bgpio_data:	shadowed data register for generic GPIO to clear/set bits safely.
 * @bgpio_dir: shadowed direction register for generic GPIO to clear/set direction safely.
 *
 * A gpio_chip can help platforms abstract various sources of GPIOs so
 * they can all be accessed through a common programing interface.
 * Example sources would be SOC controllers, FPGAs, multifunction
 * chips, dedicated GPIO expanders, and so on.
 *
 * Each chip controls a number of signals, identified in method calls
 * by "offset" values in the range 0..(@ngpio - 1).  When those signals
 * are referenced through calls like gpio_get_value(gpio), the offset
 * is calculated by subtracting @base from the gpio number.
