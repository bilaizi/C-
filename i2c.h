/**
 * struct i2c_driver - represent an I2C device driver
 * @class: What kind of i2c device we instantiate (for detect)
 * @attach_adapter: Callback for bus addition (deprecated)
 * @probe: Callback for device binding - soon to be deprecated
 * @probe_new: New callback for device binding
 * @remove: Callback for device unbinding
 * @shutdown: Callback for device shutdown
 * @alert: Alert callback, for example for the SMBus alert protocol
 * @command: Callback for bus-wide signaling (optional)
 * @driver: Device driver model driver
 * @id_table: List of I2C devices supported by this driver
 * @detect: Callback for device detection
 * @address_list: The I2C addresses to probe (for detect)
 * @clients: List of detected clients we created (for i2c-core use only)
 * @disable_i2c_core_irq_mapping: Tell the i2c-core to not do irq-mapping
 *
 * The driver.owner field should be set to the module owner of this driver.
 * The driver.name field should be set to the name of this driver.
 *
 * For automatic device detection, both @detect and @address_list must
 * be defined. @class should also be set, otherwise only devices forced
 * with module parameters will be created. The detect function must
 * fill at least the name field of the i2c_board_info structure it is
 * handed upon successful detection, and possibly also the flags field.
 *
 * If @detect is missing, the driver will still work fine for enumerated
 * devices. Detected devices simply won't be supported. This is expected
 * for the many I2C/SMBus devices which can't be detected reliably, and
 * the ones which can always be enumerated in practice.
 *
 * The i2c_client structure which is handed to the @detect callback is
 * not a real i2c_client. It is initialized just enough so that you can
 * call i2c_smbus_read_byte_data and friends on it. Don't do anything
 * else with it. In particular, calling dev_dbg and friends on it is
 * not allowed.
